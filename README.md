# It's crap-uploader, wow!
This uploads crap to to ComicFury, which I'm told is a webcomic hosting website. Their bulk uploader is very not good. This inspired a friend of mine to construct a Rube Goldberg atrocity of mouse-and-keyboard macros that were controlling the the regular uploader 'by hand'.

That nightmare inspired this. You configure it with your ComicFury credentials and the locations of and metadata about the images you want to upload.

This allows you to sidestep (possibly actually just several bugs) limitations of their unfriendly upload UI. It is useful if you want to migrate your content from a different webcomic host to ComicFury, as was the case here.

I put this together between Destiny matches. Be gentle.
